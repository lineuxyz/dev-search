  <p>What is search dev?</p>
</h2>

<p align="center">Search dev is an app where you can find other devs within a radius of 10kms next to you according to the technologies you are looking for, just register on the website (frontend) and search for devs through the application (mobile)

  <p>How to use</p>
</h2>

<p align="center">After cloning the project, you must run a yarn start within all 3 parts of the project (Backend, Frontend and mobile). For the project to work it is very simple, in the backend folder you just need to run a yarn dev, in the frontend you run yarn start and in the mobile expo start. After that the project will work, just stay tuned in the mobile part, because in the services folder, in the api.js file you need to change the url that coast so that it will appear in your project, and if it will run on an android device also stay attentive to the respective url.</p>

  <p>What I used in development?
</p>
</h2>

<p align="center">For backend I preferred to use Node, along with express, on the frontend use the Facebook lib, ReactJS, on mobile I also used React Native, along with the expo. I chose to use a non-relational bank, and at that point I chose the mongo for its great integration with the node, for animation of the home screen I used the Airbnb Lottie.
